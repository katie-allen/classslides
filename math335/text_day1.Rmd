## Spiritual Thought

<br>

Elder Bednar

> As the wise virgins emphasized properly, each of us must "buy for ourselves." These inspired women were not describing a business transaction; rather, they were emphasizing our individual responsibility to keep our lamp of testimony burning and to obtain an ample supply of the oil of conversion. This precious oil is acquired one drop at a time-"line upon line [and] precept upon precept" (2 Nephi 28:30), patiently and persistently. No shortcut is available; no last-minute flurry of preparation is possible.

## Patterns in Text

<br>

Base R (aka, functions included with default R installation) has a lot of useful function for strings.

The tidyverse `stringr` package does even more. (Use the [cheatsheet](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) this week!)

- Remember: *Anything you want to do someone has done before, and probably posted about it online.*
- Helpful to know: I use the words text, character, and string the same.

## Coding Example

> - A really good way to learn a new function is **trying to break it**.
