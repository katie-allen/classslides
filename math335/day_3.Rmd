# tidyverse {data-background=#e8d725}

## tidyverse

This is a group of packages that are designed to work together all using a "tidy" framework (we'll learn about later). Loading the tidyverse loads all the packages at once.

It also loads many datasets. Find a dataset you are interested in: data()

## Viewing data

Compare these methods for your chosen dataset

> - simpling typing the dataset's name
> - head()
> - str()
> - glimpse() (only available in tidyverse)
> - View()

## The pipe `%>%`

You can read it as a series of imperative statements: group, then summarize, then filter. As suggested by the reading, a good way to pronounce %>% when reading code is **"then"**.

* Behind the scenes, x %>% f(y) turns into f(x, y), and x %>% f(y) %>% g(z) turns into g(f(x, y), z) and so on. 
* You can use the pipe to rewrite multiple operations in a way that you can read left-to-right, top-to-bottom. 
* We'll use piping frequently from now on because it considerably improves the readability of code.

simple example: pipe your chosen dataset into one of the functions on the previous slide




## Manuevering in R

- Make sure you note what `Alt + Shift + K` does?
<!-- I like ctrl + shift + c, to comment blocks of code and add comments in an Rmd file -->
<!-- I also like the command/control enter to run a line of code -->
- Your favorite shortcut keys?
- Edit the options in Tools

## Newbie Coding Mistakes

- [Which common mistake are you most guilty of?](https://jscomplete.com/learn/pro-programmer/beginner-programmers-mistakes)

## Interpret these error statements

Take some time at your table to work out what the error statement is saying about your code. Fix the error and get the code to run.

```{R, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(dota = mpg) + 
+   geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
#> Error in structure(list(data = data, layers = list(), 
#> scales = scales_list(),  : 
#>  argument "data" is missing, with no default
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)
#> Error in fliter(mpg, cyl = 8) : could not find function "fliter"
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
filter(diamond, carat > 3)
#> Error in filter(diamond, carat > 3) : object 'diamond' not found
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data.frame(1:10,10:1,)
#> Error in data.frame(1:10, 10:1, ) : argument is missing, with no default
```

# Upcoming Work {data-background=#e8d725}

## Study Strategy for Success

- Before Tuesday
    - Complete the being readings, taking notes as you go
    - Complete "doing" reading for Tuesday's task.
    - Read Tuesday's class task. Spend 15 minutes digging into it
    - Read Thursday's class task
    - Read Case Study
- Before Thursday
    - Complete Thursday's "doing" reading
    - Complete Case Study "doing" reading
    - Spend 30 minutes on Thursday's class task before class
    - Spend 20 minutes on Case Study before class

## Look ahead

> - Read with your group task 2, task 3, and Case Study 1 (due this Saturday). Make sure your group understands the deliverables and has a good picture of how to complete them.

> - [Submit GitHub usernames](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13aQsQYnGTQXyyBUGzE1V9MExEvG5woAmygtkdjltdjk/edit#gid=59053514)

> - [submit names to be a leader next week](https://webmailbyui-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/drp36_byui_edu/EVHSwJjW-91Fm7vUr-fpjBgBvGAyqDC4csYqdXzrANdiNA?e=7bO4PF)

## ggplot2 and iris data

Use the `iris` data to create a faceted visualization. Encode data in a `color`, `shape`, and `size` layer or geometry.

Add a layer that pulls from a different data set
<!-- ggplot(iris) + geom_point(aes(x=Sepal.Length, y= Sepal.Width, color = Species, shape = Species, size = Petal.Length)) + facet_wrap(vars(Species)) + scale_shape_manual(values =  c(1, 5, 7)) + geom_hline(data = avgwid, aes(yintercept = avg)) -->
