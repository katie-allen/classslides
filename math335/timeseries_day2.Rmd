[The Ethical Data Scientist](https://slate.com/technology/2016/02/how-to-bring-better-ethics-to-data-science.html)

## Reading Discussion

<br>

- "If the data scientist's goal is to create automated processes that affect people's lives, then he or she should regularly consider ethics in a way that academics in computer science and statistics, generally speaking, do not."
- "The ethical data scientist would strive to improve the world, not repeat it. That would mean deploying tools to explicitly construct fair processes. As long as our world is not perfect, and as long as data is being collected on that world, we will not be building models that are improvements on our past unless we specifically set out to do so."

## View Data at the Atomic Level

"None of us would admit now that we didn't realize...there...had to be spread in the data; we...just didn't realize how big it could be."

> - What key observations came by looking at the data
>   - small sample sizes
>   - values above 100%
>   - increasing # of patients at 100%
> - The Mean is Not the Distribution

# Interactive Graphs {data-background=#e8c35d}

## Example: `library(DT)`

Make a new Rmd file that just has the following in it (including the default yaml). 

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(DT)
datatable(iris)
```

Then, try knitting and pushing the files to GitHub

## Setting up R-Studio

> - Visit https://shiny.byui.edu/connect and log-in
> - Click on the publish button and choose "Manage Accounts"
> - Click the "connect" button and ensure the "Enable publishing to RStudio Connect" is checked
> - Use shiny.byui.edu as the server name.
> - Then knitting the .rmd file they click on the publish button

## Example: `library(DT)`

Look at the [DT: An R interface to the DataTables library](http://rstudio.github.io/DT/) website and find one or two modifications that you could make to your table output to move beyond the default.
