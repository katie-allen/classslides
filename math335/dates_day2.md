## The March Visualization

In his iconic flow map of Napoleon's catastrophic 1812 invasion of Russia, Charles Joseph Minard blends and bends temporal and spatial representations. The path and number of outward-bound soldiers is represented by an initially thick tan ribbon while the dwindling numbers of retreating survivors are represented by a narrowing black band. In this visualization, the time it took to march into Russia is not clear. The only time stamps shown are for the return trip and progressing from right to left. In a sense, time is "bent" to advance the impact of the visual narrative.
