## Wednesday

<br>

Remember Wednesday is a work day. I will be on zoom (but not in the classroom) to answer questions during class.

## Presentation Outline

<br>

Friday we will **all meet on zoom**. In your breakout room, take turns presenting projects.

- Share your screen.
- You get 5 minutes to present.
- Then 1 or 2 minutes to answer questions from the group.


## Presentation Outline

<br>

What should you talk about for 5 minutes?

- Introduce your project/goals/questions
- Where did you find your data?
- What problems did you have with your data?
- How did you wrangle your data? 
  - Did you learn anything new?
  - What was your wrangling goal?
- What visualizations did you choose to make? 
  - How do they help answer your original question?
  - Did you learn any new methods/functions?
  - Did you gain any insights into your data?
- What theories/ideas do you have to explain what you saw in your data?
- If you kept working on this project, what would be the "next steps"?

## Presentation Tips

<br>

Think about good and bab presentations you have seen. (TED talks, class lectures, general conference, etc.)

What made the good ones "good" and the bad ones "bad"?

## How to write a GitHub issue

<br>

As part of the semester project, you will need to provide feedback to at least one of the students in your breakout room. The feedback needs to be in a GitHub "issue".

## Hustle culture

## [Workism Is Making Americans Miserable](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/religion-workism-making-americans-miserable/583441/?fbclid=IwAR1CiPDQJ8WpE7IyxwXBB_-cyy2gLo3Ecvhjbl3ude9_JRU5XcHTlcVtGKI)

<section style="text-align: left;">

- In the past century, the American conception of work has shifted from jobs to careers to callings - from necessity to status to meaning. In an agrarian or early-manufacturing economy, where tens of millions of people perform similar routinized tasks, there are no delusions about the higher purpose of, say, planting corn or screwing bolts: It's just a job.
- The rise of the professional class and corporate bureaucracies in the early 20th century created the modern journey of a career, a narrative arc bending toward a set of precious initials: VP, SVP, CEO. The upshot is that for today's workists, **anything short of finding one's vocational soul mate means a wasted life.**
- "We've created this idea that the meaning of life should be found in work," says Oren Cass, the author of the book The Once and Future Worker. "We tell young people that their work should be their passion. 'Don't give up until you find a job that you love!' we say. 'You should be changing the world!' we tell them. That is the message in commencement addresses, in pop culture, and frankly, in media, including The Atlantic."
- **But our desks were never meant to be our altars.**
- The problem with this gospel - Your dream job is out there, so never stop hustling - is that it's a blueprint for spiritual and physical exhaustion. Long hours don't make anybody more productive or creative; they make people stressed, tired and bitter.

## It's a Wonderful Life

<br>

**George:** I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office...I'd go crazy. I want to do something big and something important.

**Dad:** You know, George, I fell that in a small way we *are* doing something important.
