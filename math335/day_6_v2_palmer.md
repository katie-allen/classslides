<!-- ## How does data change belief? -->

<!-- ## To understand God's thoughts we must study statistics, for these are the measure of His purpose. -->

<!-- -Florence Nightingale ([Coxcomb graph](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale#/media/File:Nightingale-mortality.jpg)) -->

<!-- <small> -->
<!-- Her most famous graph, displayed at the top of this article, shows the number of soldier deaths per month from various causes. Each pie slice represents a different month, from April 1854 through March 1856, and each color stands for a different cause of death. It takes just a quick glance to achieve the two main takeaways: that disease, colored blue, killed far more soldiers than either "wounds" (red) or "other" (black), and that it was reduced greatly in 1855. -->

<!-- ## What changed Britian's mind? -->

<!-- After she completed her report, Nightingale worked hard to turn its conclusions into common knowledge, privately distributing it to influential people and writing several more reports, many of which included coxcombs. When she received push back from Army doctors, who thought sanitary measures a waste of money, she even leaked some of her charts to the press. -->

## Virtual Questions and Support

Build skills and experience from classes. Don't just take classes!

* How is slack working?

* Data Science lab (in-person and virtual)

* Github working correctly?



## Getting the Routine Down

- **You should push at least three times a week**
- Being Readings in Perusall/Ilearn
- Create an issue for each "complete" assignment
    - Put the hours required for completion in the issue
    - Put a link to the md file, or the folder with the images
    - You should address and Case Study feedback and close the issue within a week so you don't fall behind (the sooner the better)
    - Task issues will be closed by TA's if complete, or feedback will be given you need to address. 

# Wrap-up from last time {data-background=#e8d725}

# Look ahead {data-background=#e8d725}

## Questions?

* Questions about the upcoming task
* Questions about upcoming case study

## Pseudocode

* Pseudocode: A notation resembling a simplified programming language, used in program design.
* With your group, use data verbs and pseudocode to write your plan of attack for Task 6 and Case Study 3
  *   This may require you to do some initial data exploration to understand the dataset better
