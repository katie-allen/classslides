# GitHub and Git

## Really do I have to learn Git and GitHub

[2015 Wired Magazine Article](https://www.wired.com/2015/03/github-conquered-google-microsoft-everyone-else/)

- GitHub now boasts almost 9 million registered users. Each month, about 20 million others visit without registering. ... among the **top 100 most popular sites on earth**.
- everyone hosts their open source projects on GitHub, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, and even Microsoft. 
- the site as a kind of bazaar that offers just about any piece of code you might want-and so much of it free. "If you need something, you just go to GitHub," he says. "You will find it there."

##  Making sure we are all on the same page

<!-- Just do a quick demo to repeat what is in the video, then just ask for questions. -->
<!-- Here's a link to the video:  -->

<!-- I have created a video that walks through installing git on your computer and linking your github account to an RStudio project. I highly recommend you watch the video and try these steps before coming to class. Though the video follows the instructions in the Task 4 reading, there is a small difference. Namely, in Step 1 of Test Drive RStudio and Github, it asks you to create a repository, but we have actually already created your repositories for you already. -->

<!-- If you run into trouble, do not worry. We'll use the last 30-40 minutes of class to help those who are having trouble. But if you get it done in advance without problems you will be able to leave early, you won't be stuck waiting around. Thanks -->

Let's take a few minutes to make sure everyone is up to date with the following tasks.
