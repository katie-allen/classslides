There are three checkpoints during the semester:

> - Case Study 2 (this week): Pick a question
> - Task 11 (week 6) : Find your data
> - Case Study 13 (week 13) : Get feedback on your project, refine it, and submit

# Looking Ahead {data-background=#f7d754}

## What you should have completed by the end of this week:

- Task 1
- Task 2
- Case Study 1
- Week 2 Being Readings
- Task 3 (push to GitHub)
- Task 4 (push to GitHub)
- Case Study 2 (push to GitHub)

## Case Study 2

- Think of a few questions you *could* ask.
- Get feedback on those questions
  - classmates, spouse/roomates, family, strangers, etc.
- Pick one question to focus on
- Ask *someone who works with data* about the quality of the question, and if it can be answered in 2 months
  - If not, consider picking a different question
- Keep track of all your notes/feedback in the **readme.md** file

# Github {data-background=#f7d754}

> - File structure
> - Example
> - Open lab time

## Do I really have to learn Git and GitHub?

- Yes
- Github is used by [40 million developers worldwide](https://venturebeat.com/2019/08/08/githubs-actions-gets-continuous-integration-support-and-workflow-suggestions/).
- There are over [100 million repositories](https://expandedramblings.com/index.php/github-statistics/) on GitHub
- GitHub has [32 million monthly visitors](https://expandedramblings.com/index.php/github-statistics/)
- Everyone hosts their open source projects on GitHub including [Google, Facebook, Twitter, and even Microsoft](https://www.wired.com/2015/03/github-conquered-google-microsoft-everyone-else/). 
- GitHub is like a bazaar that offers just about any piece of code you might want - and so much of it free. ["If you need something, you just go to GitHub. You will find it there."](https://www.wired.com/2015/03/github-conquered-google-microsoft-everyone-else/)
