## Semester Project

<br>

A "choose your own adventure" case study.

## Semester Project

<br>

Requirements:

Show me you've learned something in class. 

You should be able to load data, wrangle data, and visualize data effectively. Your analysis should be well written, contain thoughtful descriptions, and tell a story.

# Relational Data {data-background=#e8c35d}

## What are "relational data"?

<br>

Relational data are multiple tables of data that have defined relationships with each other.

Relational data make it easy to store information about many different base units.

## Example

<br>

```
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

?flights
?airports
```

## Why is learning to work with relational data important?

<br>

> "It's rare that a data analysis involves only a single table of data. Typically you have many tables of data, and you must combine them to answer the questions that you're interested in."

## Why is learning to work with relational data important?

<br>

> - There are many types of databases, but relational databases have [dominated since the 1980s](https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-database.html). 
> - You will often have to combine data from different sources to answer business questions.

## [Keys](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html)

<br>

What could we use to connect the `flights` and `airports` datasets?

- The variables used to connect tables are called "keys"
- A **primary key** uniquely identifies an observation in its own table (one or more variables)
- A **foreign key** uniquely identifies an observation in another table
- A primary key and the corresponding foreign key in another table form a **relation**.

# Joining Datasets {data-background=#e8c35d}

## Example 

<br>

Join the `flights` and `airlines` datasets.

<br>

- What do we want the output to look like?
- What is the primary key?
- What is the foreign key?
- `flights %>% dplyr::left_join(airlines, by = "carrier")`
- What happens if I flip the data sets? `airlines %>% dplyr::left_join(flights, by = "carrier")`

## Your turn

<br>

How could we join the `flights` and `airports` data to show the full name of the airport in the `flights`? Post your code in slack.

- It depends. Do we want the origin or destination airport name? Or both?
- Origin: `flights %>% left_join(airports, by = c("origin" = "faa"))`
- Destination: `flights %>% left_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))`
- Both: `flights %>% left_join(airports, by=c("origin" = "faa")) %>% left_join(airports, by=c("dest" = "faa"))`

## How to make sure a key is unique

<br>

```{r}
planes %>% count(tailnum) %>% filter(n > 1)
flights %>% count(flight) %>% filter(n > 1)
```

## What happend if you have duplicate keys?

<br>

> - [One table w/ duplicates](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/join-one-to-many.png)
> - [Both tables w/ duplicates](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/join-many-to-many.png)

## In-depth example

<br>

<!----
**Partner-up**: 1 is a problem solver and tells what to do. The other is the coder and codes up the solution.
---->

> - For each tailnumber in `planes` data table, you want to know which carrier is operating it (using the `flights` data).
> - *Bonus*: Include the carrier's full name (in `airlines`), not just the 2 digit abbreviation.


```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
planes  %>% 
  left_join(flights, by = "tailnum") %>% 
  distinct(tailnum, carrier) %>% #If I stop here, there are a few duplicate tailnumbers, they were operated by multiple carriers. Because flights is sorted in chronological order, I just take the last (or most recent one) to remove the duplicates
  group_by(tailnum) %>% 
  summarise_all(last)  %>% #or I could have done slice(n())

#Now to get the full carrier's name
left_join(airlines)

```

## Mutating joins

<br>

The `left_join` we just practiced will be the most common join you use. In the `dplyr` package, it is called a *mutating join*.

>- [A venn diagram for mutating joins.](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/join-venn.png)

## Other types of joins

<br>

> - [Filtering joins](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#filtering-joins) don't add columns. They are an efficient way to filter on multiple columns.
>- [Set operations](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#set-operations) work with individual rows, comparing each value in the rows.
