## Task 6

<!-----------------------
Note:
want to students to focus on picking a TOPIC and QUESTION,
rather than finding the perfect data right now.

There is a task in a few weeks (task 11???)
that tells them to find the data for their project
-------------------------->

<!---------------------
With a partner (or in the Zoom chat), write this code out in an English paragraph.

```{r weirdname, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
delays <- flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  filter(count > 20, dest != "HNL")
```
