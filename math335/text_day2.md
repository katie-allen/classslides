# Welcome to class! {data-background=#e8c35d}

# This week I learned...  {data-background=#e8c35d}

<!----------------------
# Coding Challenge #1 {data-background=#e8c35d}

## Some Notes

**Formatting**

- Don't load packages you don't need
- If something doesn't work and time runs out, don't delete all your code. Let me see what you tried!
- Keep track of all the variables you make (aka, don't make variables in the console)
- Please submit html files!

<br>

**Problem Solving**

- *Look* at your data. Shape, size, number of columns, etc.
- Repetative code? There's a better way.
  - R is a "vectorized" language
  - `group_by()`
- The danger of joins dropping rows. Are you *sure* your keys match up? What happens if  they don't?
