# "Big" Data (Josh Wills) {data-background=#e8d725}

## Scientists Vs. Analysts (Josh Wills)

> - Best way to differentiate a data scientist from a data analyst. 
>    - **Data Analyst:** If my tools and data can't answer a question, then the question doesn't get answered.
>    - **Data Scientist:** If my tools and data can't answer a question, then I go get better tools and data.

## [Gelman's Conclusion](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/allmaps.pdf)

Mapping raw data can lead to spurious spatial features. For example, regions can appear highly variable because of small sample sizes in spatial sub-units (as in the radon example) or small populations [(as in the cancer example)](https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170124123712-01-cancer-cluster-maps--exlarge-169.jpg), and these apparently variable regions contain a disproportionate number of very high (or low) observed parameter values

Furthermore, maps really do make convenient look-up tables (what is the cancer rate, or mean radon level, in my county?). Unfortunately, even maps that are intended to be used only as look-up tables are almost sure to be used for identifying spatial features â€“ we find it very hard to suppress this instinct ourselves

# How have we dealt with maps? {data-background=#e8d725}

## Is the earth flat?

<blockquote class="twitter-video" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Kyrie Irving was trending on Twitter today because he believes the Earth is flat.

## Which area is larger - The continental 48 states or the country of Brazil?

- While a few basketbal players may think the earth is flat, is education feeding us stuff that isn't true?
- [Boston has concerns about our map education](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/mar/19/boston-public-schools-world-map-mercator-peters-projection)

## What are projections?

* **Which map is correct?**
* **Which map shows area correctly?**

![](../images/mercator.jpg){ width=40% } ![](../images/gall-peters.png){ width=45% } 

## When we make a map, what is our goal?

* ![](../images/cahill-keyes.jpg){ width=80% }
* The [cahill-keyes projection looks pretty good](https://xkcd.com/977/) or [check this out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD7ED12XGFo).

## What is GDAL?

The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) is a C/C++ geospatial data format translation programming library and associated set of utility programs built using the library. GDAL is one of the jewels of the open source community, and I want to help you understand how to leverage its power to process spatial data.

# Maps Vs. Variables {data-background=#e8d725}

## What is wrong?

"Here, you can take that, that's the final map of the numbers," Trump said, according to Reuters.  "It's pretty good, right? The red is obviously us." [1](http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-2016-electoral-map-reuters-interview-xi-jinping-china-2017-4)

[Trump Map Tweet](../images/trump_map_tweet.png)

## How could we spatially depict the variable of interest?

- [Chloropleth Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map)
- [Cartograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartogram)
- [geofacets](https://hafen.github.io/geofacet/)

## geofacet challenge

**Use the geofacet package to build a map that depicts the important variables more than the spatial area.**

> - Will need to aggregate your data to the state level.
> - Will need to use `install.packages("geofacet")` and the `facet_geo()` function.
