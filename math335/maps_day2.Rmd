## What is a Geographic CRS?

<br>

When we want to pinpoint a location on the globe, we typically use latitude and longitude angles. For example, [40 degrees north and 50 degrees east ](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics/spatial-data-r/geographic-vs-projected-coordinate-reference-systems-UTM/).

## What is a Geographic CRS?

<br>

A **geographic coordinate reference system** is the mapping (the connection) between a lat/long location (like 40 N 50 E) and an actual, physical location on the map.

<br>

A geographic CRS uses a perfect sphere to create this mapping. However, the earth is not a perfect sphere! [Now what?](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/mapping/gcs_vs_pcs/)

## What is a "datum"?

<br>

There are many different geographic CRS systems. These different systems are defined by their reference point, which is called a **datum**.

<br>

## What about map projections?

<br>

Once we know what geographic CRS we are using, we then need to decide what map projection, or "projected CRS" to use to convert 3D information (the lat/long coordinates) to 2D information (like an x,y point). [*ref*](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/mapping/gcs_vs_pcs/)

## In Summary

<br>

>- A geographic CRS defines where the data is located on the earth's surface. (In 3D!)
>- A projected CRS tells the computer how to put the data on a flat surface. (2D)


<!-----------------


- "**Map projections** try to portray the surface of the earth, or a portion of the earth, on a flat piece of paper or computer screen."
- "A **coordinate reference system** (CRS) then defines how the two-dimensional, projected map in your GIS relates to real places on the earth."

## Prepping for Class Task

Write out in a sentence what this code is doing. Make sure to catch the key points in your sentence

Note: file_delete and dir_delete are part of the fs package 

```{r p1, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
pacman::p_load(downloader, sf, fs, tidyverse)
dams_path <- "https://research.idwr.idaho.gov/gis/Spatial/Hydrography/streams_lakes/c_250k/hyd250.zip"
df <- tempfile(); uf <- tempfile()
download(dams_path, df, mode = "wb")
unzip(df, exdir = uf)
rivers <- read_sf(uf)
file_delete(df); dir_delete(uf)

```

## Working with spatial data in R

<br>

>- What info is contained in a [CRS](https://mgimond.github.io/Spatial/coordinate-systems-in-r.html#assigning-a-coordinate-system)?
>- In R, you can use define a projected CRS with:
>   - a "Proj4" string, or
>   - a specific "EPSG" number
>- [Find an EPSG](https://epsg.org/home.html)

<!-- EPSG is a set of pre-defined CRS's that is maintained by the IOGP Geomatic's Committee. (Some industry group) -->

## Using the sf package to work with CRS

Run the code below, what do you get?

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ID_counties <- USAboundaries::us_counties(states = "ID")
st_crs(ID_counties)
```

## Coding Example: Changing the projection

>- Change the CRS associated with the dataset
>- Change the projection on the fly when creating a visualization

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
my_proj <- "+proj=robin +datum=WGS84"
ID_tr <- ID_counties %>% st_transform(crs = my_proj)
st_crs(ID_tr)
#Note the change in the CRS, and the lack of an EPSG

#Compare the following two plots
ggplot() + geom_sf(data = ID_counties) + theme_bw()
ggplot() + geom_sf(data = ID_tr) + theme_bw()

#Now change the projection on the fly instead of the actual dataset
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = ID_counties) + 
  theme_bw() +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(my_proj))

#Doing a similar thing, but with a predefined EPSG
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = ID_counties) + 
  theme_bw() +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(5041))
```

## Convert to another projection

Go to class activity in I-learn to change your previous tasks's map to a different projection. (or advance to the next two slides). Let's have a few people share.

[Old activity instructions](https://byuistats.github.io/M335/spatial_class.html)

## Using an EPSG number

<br>

Altering the projection by using an EPSG

* Search for an EPSG that works: https://epsg.org/home.html.

## Using a Proj4 string

<br>

Altering the projection parameters of the CRS in the proj4 string

* Here is a nice list of some standard examples (http://www.radicalcartography.net/?projectionref). Look in the "Name" column for names of differnet projections.
* Then we can 'search' for that name here: projection type (http://spatialreference.org/ref/).
    *  Click on "Proj4" to get the proj4string.
        * Look specifically at the input for the "+proj=" argument.
    *  The proj4 format information can be helpfull12.
* There are many online examples3 of using R for spatial as well.

Note the use of +lat_0=45 and +lon_0=-115 and what they do your map.
