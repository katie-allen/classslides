# Reading Discussion {data-background=#e8c35d}

## [The Data Science Process](https://medium.springboard.com/the-data-science-process-the-complete-laymans-guide-to-what-a-data-scientist-actually-does-ca3e166b7c67)

<br>

What are your thoughts?

Get into groups of 2 or 3 and share.

## The Data Science Process

<br>

> "I realized that despite the variation in the details of different projects, the steps that data scientists use to work through a complex business problem remain more or less the same."

[One of my favorite examples.](https://strimas.com/)

## The Data Science Process

<br>

1. Frame the problem (translation)
1. Collect the raw data needed to solve the problem
1. Process the data (data wrangling)
1. Explore the data
1. Perform in-depth analysis (machine learning, statistical models, algorithms)
1. Communicate results of the analysis (translation)

# R, RStudio, Markdown, and R Markdown {data-background=#e8c35d}

## R vs R Scripts

## Markdown

<br>

Example in Slack.

## R Markdown

<br>

[What is R Markdown?](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)

"A reproducible record of your work."

## Why do we care about reproducibility?

## Reproducibility

<br>

Let's do an experiment. Close your eyes.

- Those two recordings were made 20 years apart.

## Reproducibility

<br>

The music was written around 1804.
