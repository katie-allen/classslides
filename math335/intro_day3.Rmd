## What is data science?

## Workload to get an "A"

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=14}
library(tidyverse)

weeks <- tibble(Week = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), 
       low  = c(4, 8, 10, 10, 12, 11, 9, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6),
       high = c(6, 12, 14, 14, 16, 14, 12, 9, 9, 9, 9, 11, 11))


weeks %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Week)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = low, color = "Minimum"), size = 2.5) +
  geom_line(aes(y = low, color = "Minimum")) +
  geom_point(aes(y = high, color = "Max"), size = 2.5) +
  geom_line(aes(y = high, color = "Max")) +
  labs(y = "Hours per week", x = "Week of semester", title = "Number of hours to earn an A") +
  theme_bw() + theme(panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 20)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:13) + scale_color_manual("Range", values = c("dodgerblue3", "orange3"))

```


## To get a "B"

You don't do **B** work on all the tasks and case studies - You do **A** work on half of them.

* Focus on the first 5-weeks material. Pick and choose work after the foundation material.
* I know everyone can earn a B or higher.

## 7 methods of encoding data

#### Ordered by accuracy of perceptual estimation.

1. Position along a common scale
2. Position on common, non-aligned scale
3. Length
4. Angle or slope
5. Area
6. Volume/density/saturation of "color"
7. Color hue

## Quote from Tufte

> Above all else, show the data
