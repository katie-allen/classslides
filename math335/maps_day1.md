## [Gelman's Conclusion](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/allmaps.pdf)

Mapping raw data can lead to spurious spatial features. For example, regions can appear highly variable because of small sample sizes in spatial sub-units (as in the radon example) or small populations [(as in the cancer example)](https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170124123712-01-cancer-cluster-maps--exlarge-169.jpg), and these apparently variable regions contain a disproportionate number of very high (or low) observed parameter values

Furthermore, maps really do make convenient look-up tables (what is the cancer rate, or mean radon level, in my county?). Unfortunately, even maps that are intended to be used only as look-up tables are almost sure to be used for identifying spatial features â€“ we find it very hard to suppress this instinct ourselves

## Which area is larger?

<br>

The continental 48 states or the country of Brazil?

## When we make a map, what is our goal?

- Your goal will change which projection you use.

## What is GDAL?

The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) is a C/C++ geospatial data format translation programming library and associated set of utility programs built using the library. GDAL is one of the jewels of the open source community, and I want to help you understand how to leverage its power to process spatial data.

# Geospatial data in R {data-background=#e8c35d}

## sp and sf

<br>

In R, there are two main lineages of tools for dealing with spatial data: `sp` and `sf`.

>- `sp` has been around for a while, but is complex and difficult to use
>- `sf` was first released in 2016. Much easier to use with the tidyverse

## USAboundaries

<br>

The `USAboundaries` package contains functions that return `sf` files for US states, counties, and cities.

## Demo

<br>

Start by installing the packages:

```
install.packages("sf")
install.packages("USAboundaries")
```

## Demo

<br>

```
idaho <- us_states(states = "Idaho")
View(idaho)
```
<br>

What do you notice about the [structure of the data](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html)?

## Demo

<br>

```
plot(idaho$geometry)

ggplot() + geom_sf(data = idaho)
```
