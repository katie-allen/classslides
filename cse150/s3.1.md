With bad charts, instead of using the chart to guide the meeting, each member has to assign meaning themselves. The team members must slow down purposeful thinking and shift the focus of the meeting to understanding the chart instead of insight and decision making. Everyone gets distracted trying to figure the chart out as quickly as possible. The stress rises as understanding fades. A thought accident is grinding insight to a halt. Some participants are shifting attention to their phones or screens to avoid the collision. We are reading the chart instead of using it to get where the meeting is intended to go!

# Case Study {data-background=#6897bb}

## Review: Lego Case Study

1. Who is willing to let me share their visualization with the class from the LEGO project?
2. What do you think about the new deliverables for future semesters?
3. Each presentation is your own work and should show your personal style. You work with partners for ideas not to have the same product.

## Running marathons
