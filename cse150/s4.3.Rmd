# Dimension vs. Attribute vs. Measure {data-background=#f7d754}

## Most often:

**You will often hear variables described as *quantitative* or *qualitative*.**

- *Quantitative* sounds like "quantity", which is a number. Also called *numerical*.
- *Qualitative* sounds like "quality", which is a description like good/better/best. Also called *categorical*.

## In Tableau:

**Tablaeu has its own vocabulary, which can be annoying.**

- Quantitative/numerical variables are called *measures*. (Think "can I measure this?") Measures can be aggregated (and often are by default).
- Qualitative/categorical variables are called *dimensions*. Dimenions affect the "level of detail" in your graph.

**The color of a variables pill gives us additional information:**

- *Green* pills are continuous (can have ANY value).
- *Blue* pills are discrete (can only have specific values).

## But what about attributes?

- **Dimensions** affect the "level of detail".
- **Measures** are used to aggregate data.
- **Attributes** are also a type of aggregation, meaning they tell you *one* thing about *many* data points. Attributes find the *common ground* between data points.



# Z-Scores {data-background=#f7d754}

##

Calculate the z-score for your own height and add it to the google document.

>- Heights of adult men in the United States are normally distributed with a mean of 70 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches.

>- Heights of adult women in the United States are normally distributed with a mean of 64.5 inches and a standard deviation of 2.5 inches.

$$Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$

## Answer these questions:

>- Who is the tallest person in our class?
>- Who's height in the most extreme, compared to their own gender?

# Case Study {data-background=#f7d754}

## [Why does height measure health?](https://www.who.int/nutgrowthdb/about/introduction/en/index2.html)

> - Let's plot each child's height by their age.
> - What can we discern about each child?
> - What can we discern about each country?

## Understanding Z-scores 

> - How can Z-scores be a measure of health?

$$Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$

## Let's check the z-score calculations of our data

> - Calculated Fields
> - Plotting LAZ by agedays
