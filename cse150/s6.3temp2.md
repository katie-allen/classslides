# Building a Story: Visual Crit {data-background=#e8c35d}

## Visual Crit

<br>

> 1. Make a note of the first few things you see.
> 2. Make a note of the first idea that forms in your mind and then search for more.
> 3. Make notes on likes, dislikes, and wish-I-saws.
> 4. Find three things you'd change and briefly say why.
> 5. Sketch and/or prototype your own version, and critique yourself.

# Case Study {data-background=#e8c35d}

## What can we do to tell a compelling story to the IRS?

<br>

The first few slides need to provide a background. Always include a chart, if possible, on each slide.

- Who are the companies?
- Which company are you going to focus in on, and why?
- More details about the focus company.

## What can we do to help them understand Benford's law and our statistical test?

<br>

We need to give them a background on the Benfords distribution and the Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test.

- How does it work?
- A short explanation of each.
- Visuals for each of our companies.

## What additional evidence can we provide for the "Government Entity"?

<br>

Can we guide the IRS where to search?

- Additional Benford plots withing sub-categories.
- Other visualizations?

## Last-digit expectations

<br>

Benford's law tells us what to expect for first digits. What about last digits?

## A conclusions slide

<br>

Wrap it up.  Make conclusions and recommendations based on the work you have done.
