<br>

- Don't be shy.
- State your purpose.

- Identify your affiliation
- Your data responsibility:
  - The data sharer becomes a team member.
  - You are not the data owner.
  - Make the proper acknowledgments.

## Call center data request

<br>

- "They told me the mean, so I asked for the raw, atomic-level data."
  - They gave him the mean with twenty decimal places
- "No, I need the data you used to get this mean."
  - After several weeks, he was given hundreds of call durations
- "Do you have the start and stop times?"
  - After several more weeks, he finally got the raw data.

## Call center data request

<br>

- How much did he have to work with when he started?
- How many times did he have to ask for data?
- What prompted him to ask for data?
- Who helped him come up with the questions?
<!--- - What were some of your favorite questions? --->
