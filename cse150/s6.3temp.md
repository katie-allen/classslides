# Building a Story: Visual Crit {data-background=#f7d754}

## Visual Crit

> 1. Make a note of the first few things you see.
> 2. Make a note of the first idea that forms in your mind and then search for more.
> 3. Make notes on likes, dislikes, and wish-I-saws.
> 4. Find three things you'd change and briefly say why.
> 5. Sketch and/or prototype your own version, and critique yourself.

## This is practice for part of our [visualization challenge](https://byuistats.github.io/CSE150/syllabus.html#Visualization_challenge).

> 1. A tidy data description from a provided chart.   
> 2. **A data journalism article review where you identify the strengths and weaknesses of the visualizations used to tell their story.**   
> 3. A visualization request to be done in Tableau with the data set that we provide.
