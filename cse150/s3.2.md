## [Using Shelves and Cards](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/buildmanual_shelves.htm)

> - The **Columns shelf** creates the columns of a table  (x-axis), while the **Rows shelf** creates the rows of a table (y-axis). You can place any number of fields on these shelves.
> - Right-click (control-click on Mac) the row or column you want to hide, and then select Hide.
> - Open the field menu for a field that has hidden columns or rows and select Show Hidden Data.
> - The Pages shelf lets you break a view into a series of pages so you can better analyze how a specific field affects the rest of the data in a view. 
> - [Measure Values and Measure Names](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/datafields_understanddatawindow_meavalues.htm)
> - [Summary Cards](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/inspectdata_summary.htm)

## Understanding the deliverables

- A **spatial** chart displays spatial data - aka, location.
- A **temporal** chart displays temporal data - aka, time. 
- A **variable summary** chart helps us understand the distribution (values and spread) of a single variable 
- The text mark in Tableau will help with the **data summary table**
