In I-Learn, go to the "Materials" module and open the "Google Sheets Tool".

## [Section 4.5 Chi-Squared Test of Independence](https://byuistats.github.io/BYUI_CSE150_StatBook/inferential-decision-making.html#chi-squared-test-of-independence)

- Null hypothesis: These two variables are independent.
- Alternative hypothesis: These two variables are *not* independent.

## Scatterplots with two measures

Finish the following sentences for comparing two measures (or "variables")

- **Positive Correlation:** As x increases y ________.
- **Negative Correlation:** As x increases y ________.
- **No Correlation:** As x increases y _________.
- If there is a relationship between x and y then knowing x gives us information about y.
- If x and y are independent then knowing x tells us nothing about y.

## Tables with two dimensions

Let's think about our counts of birth by month and sport data.

- Does being in a professional sport provide information about what month they were born in?
- If yes, they are correlated or their is a relationship. They are **not independent**.
- if no, then birthday months are **independent** of what sport a professional plays.

# Case Study {data-background=#f7d754}

## Building our data tables (Tableau)

1. Build a table that shows the sum of all births for each group and each month.
2. Build a table that shows the percentage of births by month within each sport.
3. Build a table that has the counts for the US and Baseball for July and August.

## Are birthdays and sports related?

Let's test the data in the Google Sheets Tool.

## Cut off dates

> - **Baseball:** July 31st
> - **American Football:** July 31st <!---(but it has weight limits and other dates)--->
> - **Basketball:** August 31st <!----(but it has other dates)--->
> - **Hockey:** December 31st

## Using the two proportions test.

1. How could we compare US births to Hockey births to see if there is a Matthew effect?
2. What are some other ways we could compare the two groups?
3. Which is better?
4. What concerns do you have?

<!------

## Comparing multiple variables over two populations?

> - If the Matthew effect is real, why would it only happen in certain months. Should we see a trend?
> - What are the benefits of comparing the entire trend?
> - Now that we see a difference, what would we want to do?
