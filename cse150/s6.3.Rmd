## Visual Crit

> 1. Make a note of the first few things you see.
> 2. Make a note of the first idea that forms in your mind and then search for more.
> 3. Make notes on likes, dislikes, and wish-I-saws.
> 4. Find three things you'd change and briefly say why.
> 5. Sketch and/or prototype your own version, and critique yourself.

> 3. A visualization request to be done in Tableau with the data set that we provide.
