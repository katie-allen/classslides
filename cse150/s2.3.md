## [Measures of Center](https://byuistats.github.io/BYUI_CSE150_StatBook/describing-data.html#measures-of-center)

<br>

Mean, Median, Mode

- Mean: The balancing point.
- Median: The middle (or "half way") point.
- Mode: The most common.

## Measures of Center Activity

<br>

- **Instructions:**
  - Generate 10 random numbers between 1 and 10
  - Plot the numbers on your graph
  - Calculate the mean and median. Mark them on your graph.
  - What do you notice about the mean's location, relative to the median?

<br>

- This will be easier if you pick one person to be the writer, one person to generate the random numbers, and one person to do the math.

- Why do we use measures of center?   
- Which measure of center do you prefer? 
- Which measure would represent a typical net worth of people living in Seattle better?

Percentiles and Quartiles

- Percentiles break the data into 100 groups
- Quartiles break the data into 4 groups


## [Measures of Spread](https://byuistats.github.io/BYUI_CSE150_StatBook/describing-data.html#measures-of-spread)

<br>

- Five number summary
- Standard deviation

If you were a Walmart buyer of cherry tomatoes, what specifications would you give them to make sure you got the size you wanted in the store?

- How might a supplier user your metric to their advantage?
- How could the metric provide safety for Walmart and the supplier?

## Numerical Summaries

<br>

- Are two data sets the same if they have the same mean?
- Are two data sets the same if they have the same spread?
- Are two data sets the same if they have the same mean and the same spread?

# Good Charts {data-background=#e8c35d}

## Chapter 4: Better charts in a couple of hours

![](images/gc/Ch4_building_better_charts_time.png)

> - **Prep:**  Visualization is creative communication. It takes time, so block it out in 1-2 hour chunks.
> - **Talk & Listen:** Find people that will listen and then talk their ear off.  But listen to what they don't understand.
> - **Sketch:** This is hard.  Don't be afraid to make mistakes. [Use a visualization topic guide](https://datavizcatalogue.com/) or use [good chart cheatsheet](images/gc/Ch4_chart_ideation.png).
> - **Prototype:** *Next class discussion*

## Talk, Sketch, Listen, Prototype...

After prep, all of these can happen at the same time when you are working in a group. As long as everyone has come prepared.

## Sister Larson's favorite quotes

- "Programs visualize data. People visualize ideas."
- Talk and Listen will "be the most revelatory, but also possible the least natural."
- "Sketching is generative; it's meant to bring up ideas. Prototyping is iterative; it's meant to hone good ones."

# Practice with LEGO data {data-background=#e8c35d}



## Prep

<br>

Think about what story you want to tell with your charts in Case Study 2.

>- Who are the charts for?
>- What is the most important message to share?

## With a partner:

**Talk and listen.** Share ideas with a partner about:

> - What message you want to focus on
> - Why that message is important to you
> - Good ways to communicate that message

**Sketch.** Sketch a few ideas for a chart, and then pick one you'd like to prototype.
