## Open Microsoft Teams

Today we are going to provide feedback on case studies by writing comments in Microsoft Teams.

## Examples of case study comments.

>- **Helpful feedback:**
>   - "Wow, how did you make that line chart? I really like the way it shows _______."
>   - "On this slide, I think your message would be clearer if you did _________ instead."
>- **Not helpful feedback:**
>   - "i really liked ur graphs."
>   - "your graphs could be better"

## What is normal about marathons?

Instructions for your groups/breakout rooms:

>- **When it's your turn to present:**
>   - Present your case study, explaining your graphs and the message(s) you wanted to communicate.
>- **When someone else is presenting:** 
>   - Pay attention to their presentation. Then share your feeback 1) verbally and 2) by adding a comment in Teams and tagging the student.
