# Introduction to CSE 150 {data-background=#6897bb}

## "Data Intuition and Insight"

Course Outcomes:

1. Organize and store tabular data for time-series, spatial, and measured variables.
2. Calculate data summaries and produce visualizations from data.
3. Communicate about data with people of varied backgrounds (e.g., novices, database administrators, data scientists, business decision-makers).
4. Describe the implications of data visualization and summaries in the decision-making process.

## "Data Intuition and Insight"

Or, another way to phrase it:

- Learn about the field of data science and data visualization.
- Leave this class with marketable skills.
- Discover the joy of data literacy.
















# Syllabus Overview  {data-background=#6897bb}

## Course Format

CSE 150 is built around 8 case studies. Most case studies follow this two week format:

![](images/class_format.png)

Each case study has an [overview](https://byui.instructure.com/courses/102734/pages/visualization-introduction-overview?module_item_id=13091932) that tells you exactly what to do.

## Course Content

Our assignments can be grouped into four categories:

> 1. Weekly Readings (30%)
> 2. Case Studies (55%)
> 3. Teach One Another (15%)
> 4. Visualization Challenge (10%)

## Class Discussions

CSE 150 was designed with the assumption that you will come to class **prepared** and **willing to engage** in a discussion with your peers.

> - Talking with a mask on is not fun.
> - We're going to do it anyway.

# Materials and Technology {data-background=#6897bb}

## Materials

> - [Good Charts](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Charts-Smarter-Persuasive-Visualizations/dp/1633690709)
> - [CSE 150 Supplement](https://byuistats.github.io/BYUI_CSE150_StatBook/)
> - [Tableau Videos]()

## Slack vs. Email vs. Canvas vs. Teams

> 1. Canvas is not used outside of Academia (done).
> 2. Email silos conversations, documents, and data. Plus, it hasn't changed much in [over 25 years](https://phrasee.co/a-brief-history-of-email/).
> 3. Teams vs. Slack

## Google Sheets (G Suite)

I believe that spreadsheets are useful for looking at little data sets, building tables, and collaboration. Not for data analysis. Microsoft has accepted some of this point in their development of [PowerBI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) in response to [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/).

## Google Sheets vs. Excel

# Why do we attend college? {data-background=#6897bb}

## [Peter Gray on Education](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freedom-learn/200808/brief-history-education)

Anthropologists have reported that the hunter-gatherer groups they studied did not distinguish between work and play--essentially all of life was understood as play...

With the rise of schooling, people began to think of learning as children's work. The same power-assertive methods that had been used to make children work in fields and factories were quite naturally transferred to the classroom.

**If children learn nothing else in school, they learn the difference between work and play and that learning is work, not play.**

## [Jeffry R. Holland on learning](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2018/12/making-your-life-a-soul-stirring-journey-of-personal-growth?lang=eng)

So let's talk about learning. As a teacher at heart, I love the word and the idea, though I do think we should define it a little better than we usually do. ... I don't just mean the accumulation of knowledge, though that is part of it. I also don't just mean passively listening to a lecture or memorizing facts. **I mean learning in the sense of growth and change, of insight leading to improvement, of knowing the truth, which in turn leads us closer to the God of all truth.**

## [BYU-Idaho Mission Statement](https://www.byui.edu/about/mission-statement)

To develop disciples of Jesus Christ who are leaders in their homes, the Church, and their communities.
