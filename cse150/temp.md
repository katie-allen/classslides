## "Data Intuition and Insight"

Course Outcomes:

1. Organize and store tabular data for time-series, spatial, and measured variables.
2. Calculate data summaries and produce visualizations from data.
3. Communicate about data with people of varied backgrounds (e.g., novices, database administrators, data scientists, business decision-makers).
4. Describe the implications of data visualization and summaries in the decision-making process.

## "Data Intuition and Insight"

Or, another way to phrase it:

- Learn about the field of data science and data visualization.
- Leave this class with marketable skills.
- Discover the joy of data literacy.
















# Syllabus Overview  {data-background=#6897bb}

## Course Format

CSE 150 is built around 8 case studies. Most case studies follow this two week format:

![](images/class_format.png)

Each case study has an [overview](https://byui.instructure.com/courses/102734/pages/visualization-introduction-overview?module_item_id=13091932) that tells you exactly what to do.

## Course Content

Our assignments can be grouped into four categories:

> 1. Weekly Readings (30%)
> 2. Case Studies (55%)
> 3. Teach One Another (15%)
> 4. Visualization Challenge (10%)

## Class Discussions

CSE 150 was designed with the assumption that you will come to class **prepared** and **willing to engage** in a discussion with your peers.

> - Talking with a mask on is not fun.
> - We're going to do it anyway.

# Materials and Technology {data-background=#6897bb}

## Slack vs. Email vs. Canvas vs. Teams

> 1. Canvas is not used outside of Academia (done).
> 2. Email silos conversations, documents, and data. Plus, it hasn't changed much in [over 25 years](https://phrasee.co/a-brief-history-of-email/).
> 3. Teams vs. Slack

## Google Sheets (G Suite)

I believe that spreadsheets are useful for looking at little data sets, building tables, and collaboration. Not for data analysis. Microsoft has accepted some of this point in their development of [PowerBI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) in response to [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/).

## Google Sheets vs. Excel
