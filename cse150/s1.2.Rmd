## Good Charts, Chapter 2: When Charts hit our eyes

- What were your takeaways from Chapter 2?
- Misunderstandings?
- Doubts?

## Hathaway takeaways

1. We don't go in order
2. We see what stands out
3. Don't fill up the plot
4. Humans yearn for patterns
5. Communication only happens through metaphor

- *keep track: close your eyes then take note where you looked first*

## Don't make it complicated (unless you need to)

**Try to tell me the message in the below paragraph**

## We want patterns to a fault.

**Conspiracy Theory of Charts**

> - [The case against dual axis charts](https://blog.datawrapper.de/dualaxis/)

**Only do it for transformations: ft -> meters**

## Metaphor matters in all communication

I love his symphony metaphor.

> When deeply complex charts work, we find them effective and beautiful, just as we find a symphony, which is another marvelously complex arrangement of data that we experience as a coherent whole.

## Metaphor highlights

- South is down?
- Lighter color shades are "emptier" or lower than darker ones.
- Lines imply ordered relationship
- Time moves from left to right.
- **After reading the chapter, what other metaphors could you use to describe visualization or elements of a visualization?**

# Tidy Data ([Section 1.1](https://byuistats.github.io/BYUI_CSE150_StatBook/describing-data.html#tidy-data))

## How data is stored.

*Data and how to handle it isn't trivial*

1. Visual consumption by humans
2. Computer consumption for storage
3. Analytics consumption

## How humans consume data.

## Oh no you don't

**You should never attempt all three of the above in one sheet in Excel or Google Sheets.**

*Using multiple tabs or sheets can make this possible but still not recommended.*

# Google Sheets ([Section ](https://byuistats.github.io/BYUI_CSE150_StatBook/tools.html#sheets))

## What we have to do with Google Sheets.

- [Do some calculations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KUq-7qEHB642UB9olN7Fw0Yp9pYoKyCQIhs1TCPP198/template/preview)

- [Maybe create a few simple formulas](https://support.google.com/docs/table/25273)

**Sheets is a sidenote, not our primary tool.**
