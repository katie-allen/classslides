- *One million, six million, seventy million. Spoken or written, these numbers become a buszz. Incomprehensible. Presented graphically, they hit closer to the heart. As the Soviet losses climbed, I thought my browser had frozen. Surely the top of the column bust have been reached by now, I thought.*

## Present to Persuade Summary

> - Show the chart and stop talking
> - Don't read the picture
> - For unusual visual forms, guide the audience
> - Use [reference charts](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/tom-brady-touchdown-passes/)
> - Show something simple, leave behind more detail
> - Tell stories

# Supplemental Reading: [Probability & Sampling](https://byuistats.github.io/BYUI_CSE150_StatBook/probability-sampling-and-confidence-intervals.html) {data-background=#e8c35d}

## What is probability?

## Understanding Probability

<br>

**One die probability**

What is x? What do the 1 and 6 represent?

$$p(x) = \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.1667$$

<br>

**What does it mean that rolling a die is a "random process"?**

[Simulation](https://istats.shinyapps.io/RandomNumbers/)


## Understanding Probability

<br>

**Sum of two dice probability**

What is $x$ or the event now?

- [Sum of two dice](images/other/sum_of_two_dice.jpg)

## Sampling and Probability

<br>

A study was done on the heights of BYU and BYU-Idaho students to find the probability of a student being over 6 feet tall. 

The results:

- *The probability of a BYU-Idaho student being taller than 6 feet is 20%.*
- *The probability of a BYU student being taller than 6 feet is 100%.*

<br>

- Do you believe this data? What might be the problem?
- 10 students were sampled from both schools.
- The BYU-Idaho students were randomly selected from the student population. (SRS)
- The BYU students were selected off the basketball court. (Convenience)

## Sampling and Probability

<br>

What makes a collection of data a good example or representative of the general population?

## Sampling from a Population

You have 150 students that graduated from a major in 2019 and you want to take a sample of 25 of them to estimate starting salaries.

Review the [Section 3.2](https://byuistats.github.io/BYUI_CSE150_StatBook/probability-and-sampling.html) and describe the way you would do each sampling method for the scenario above.

> - Convenience sample
> - Simple random sample (SRS) 
> - Systematic random sample 
> - Clustered random sample
> - Stratified random sample
