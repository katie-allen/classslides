# Good Charts {data-background=#e8c35d}

## Present to Persuade

*One million, six million, seventy million. Spoken or written, these numbers become a buszz. Incomprehensible. Presented graphically, they hit closer to the heart. As the Soviet losses climbed, I thought my browser had frozen. Surely the top of the column bust have been reached by now, I thought.*

## Present to Persuade Summary

> - Show the chart and stop talking
> - Don't read the picture
> - For unusual visual forms, guide the audience
> - Use reference charts
> - Show something simple, leave behind more detail
> - Tell stories

# Supplemental Reading: [Probability & Sampling](https://byuistats.github.io/BYUI_CSE150_StatBook/probability-sampling-and-confidence-intervals.html) {data-background=#e8c35d}

## What is probability?

## Understanding Probability

<br>

**One die probability**

What is x? What do the 1 and 6 represent?

$$p(x) = \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.1667$$

<br>

**What does it mean that rolling a die is a "random process"?**

## Understanding Probability

<br>

**Sum of two dice probability**

What is $x$ or the event now?

## Sampling and Probability

<br>

A study was done on the heights of BYU and BYU-Idaho students. The results:

- *The probability of a BYU-Idaho student being taller than 6 feet is 20%.*
- *The probability of a BYU student being taller than 6 feet is 100%.*

<br>

- Do you believe this data? What might be the problem?
- 10 students were sampled from both schools.
- The BYU-Idaho students were randomly selected from the student population. (SRS)
- The BYU students were selected off the basketball court. (Convenience)



## Sampling and Probability

<br>

What makes a collection of data a good example or representative of the general population?





<!----------------------------------------

## Walmart and probability

[Walmart Employees Are Out to Show Its Anti-Theft AI Doesn't Work
](https://www.wired.com/story/walmart-shoplifting-artificial-intelligence-everseen/)

[Everseen video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibIKS84ETpM): Where do you see probability in their video?  Why don't they say this word?

*“Our digital eye has perfect vision and it never needs a day off.”*

## Walmart Associate Quotes

- The same person then grabs two gallons of milk by their handles, and moves them across the scanner with one hand. Only one is rung up, but both are put in the bagging area. They then put their own cell phone on top of the machine, and an alert pops up saying they need to wait for assistance—a false positive. “Everseen finally alerts! But does so mistakenly. Oops again,” a caption reads. The filmmaker repeats the same process at two more stores, where they fail to scan a heart-shaped Valentine’s Day chocolate box with a puppy on the front and a Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush. At the end, a caption explains that Everseen failed to stop more than $100 of would-be theft.

## Sampling: Walmart and Everseen 

> - Was Everseen's video representative of the retail experience of their product? Did they show a representative sample?
> - Were the Walmart associate examples representative of Everseen's product?
- What makes a collection of data a good example or representative of the general product (population)?

## Sampling from a Population

You have 150 students that graduated from a major in 2019 and you want to take a sample of 25 of them to estimate starting salaries.

Review the [Section 3.2](https://byuistats.github.io/BYUI_CSE150_StatBook/probability-and-sampling.html) and describe the way you would do each sampling method for the scenario above.

> - Convenience sample
> - Simple random sample (SRS) 
> - Systematic random sample 
> - Clustered random sample
> - Stratified random sample



# Case Study   {data-background=#e8c35d}

## Tool Tips and Case Study Presentations

<br>

For this case study, let's try something different:

- **Presentations** and **feedback** will be done in class.
- **Tool Tips** should be done in Slack.
