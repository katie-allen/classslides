## Numerical Gestalt

**Gestalt:** an organized whole that is perceived as more than the sum of its parts.

> Saul has slain his thousands. And David his ten thousands (1 Sam. 18.7).

Cassirer observes, ... the owner of a herd of four to five hundred cattle could recognize even at a distance whether any were missing and which ones. Here individual groups are recognized and differentiated by some individual characteristic: in so far as one can speak of 'number', it appears not in the form of a specified measured magnitude, but as a kind of concrete 'numerical gestalt', an intuitive quality adhering to a totally unarticulated general impression of quantity.
