## [Why does height measure health?](https://www.who.int/nutgrowthdb/about/introduction/en/index2.html)

<br>

> - Let's plot each child's height by their age.
>   - What can we discern about each child?
>   - What can we discern about each country?

## Understanding Z-scores 

<br>

$$Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$

<br>

 - How can Z-scores be a measure of health?

##

<br>

Calculate the z-score for your own height and add it to the google document.

--->

>- Heights of adult men in the United States are normally distributed with a mean of 70 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches.

<br>

>- Heights of adult women in the United States are normally distributed with a mean of 64.5 inches and a standard deviation of 2.5 inches.

<br>

$$Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$

## Answer these questions:

<br>

>- Who is the tallest person in our class?
>- Who's height in the most extreme, compared to their own gender?


## Z-scores in Tableau

> - Let's plot each child's height z-score by their age.
>   - What can we discern about each child?
>   - What can we discern about each country?

## Let's check the z-score calculations of our data

> - Calculated Fields
> - Plotting LAZ by agedays
