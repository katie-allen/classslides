## Raw Data vs. Summaries

- What is the difference between "raw data" and "summarized data"?
- Why do we care?

# Intro to Tableau  {data-background=#e8c35d}

## Any problems?

## How to load data

## Types of variables (columns)

**Dimensions vs Measures**

> - Tableau displays dimensions (categorical variables) by their name
> - Tableau displays measures (numerical variables) as a summary

**Discrete vs Continuous**

>- Discrete variables (specific values) are blue
>- Continuous variables (any value in a range) are green

## Your turn!

- Let's use the [purchase_data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WFdhJVJpW-4V-zoCG1OK0w4EBzGvY0v4wpuvANq_rF0/edit?usp=sharing)   
- **Create a bar chart of the top 20 merchants by sales.**

## [Tools: Tableau](https://byuistats.github.io/BYUI_CSE150_StatBook/tools.html#tableau)

**Two tools: Both should work**

> - [Full Tableau Tool](https://www.tableau.com/tft/activation)
> - [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/)

**First Try**

*We have curated a list of tools readings and videos. I would not skip the material we have picked.*

> - [Connecting to Google Sheets](https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2016/5/connect-directly-your-google-sheets-tableau-10-53954)
> - [Registered Training (pill types)](https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/understanding-pill-types): Their videos are great and should be used.

# Case Study {data-background=#e8c35d}

> - [Measuring LEGO case study](https://byuistats.github.io/CSE150/project.html#Case_Study_2:_Lego_my_data) questions?   
> - Working with a partner but presenting and submitting individually.   
>    - You work together to get data recording done, but each of you creates your own visualizations and presentation.   
>    - You can use similar images, but your presentation and Tableau file should be your own creation.   
> - Case study quizes.

# Looking Ahead {data-background=#e8c35d}

## Midpoint Quiz (Saturday)

1. Have you discussed with a friend or family member (or classmates!) which variables you should record on each Lego brick?
2. Has your group started recording Lego data?
3. Has your team shared a draft (an example) of your Lego data to our class conversation space, with a short justification of what variables you are recording?

## Visualization Discussion (Monday)

Each "visualization discussion" will have [an article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/12/sports/basketball/stephen-curry-warriors-popcorn.html) to read with a chart. 

The quiz will ask you a few questions about the chart.
