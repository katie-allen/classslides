## [Tools: Tableau](https://byuistats.github.io/BYUI_CSE150_StatBook/tools.html#tableau)

**Two tools: Both should work**

> - [Full Tableau Tool](https://www.tableau.com/tft/activation)
> - [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/)

**First Try**

*We have curated a list of tools readings and videos. I would not skip the material we have picked.*

> - [Connecting to Google Sheets](https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2016/5/connect-directly-your-google-sheets-tableau-10-53954)
> - [Registered Training (pill types)](https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/understanding-pill-types): Their videos are great and should be used.  

## Working with Tableau

> - [Let's use the government_data_data4](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uPunkpysrF773ce2QxwqXiYQ3MkxaLCbXBHu3yeASfU/edit#gid=37313239)   

**Tackle the following questions**   

> - *Create a bar chart of the top 20 merchants by sales. Which are the top 2 merchants by sales?*   

# Case Study {data-background=#e8c35d}

> - [Measuring LEGO case study](https://byuistats.github.io/CSE150/project.html#Case_Study_2:_Lego_my_data) questions?   
> - Working with a partner but presenting and submitting individually.   
>    - You work together to get data recording done, but each of you creates your own visualizations and presentation.   
>    - You can use similar images, but your presentation and Tableau file should be your own creation.   
> - Case study quizes.


# Good Reads {data-background=#e8c35d}

## Chapter 4: Better Charts in a couple of hours (73-86)

![](images/gc/Ch4_building_better_charts_time.png)

> - **Prep:**  Visualization is creative communication. It takes time, so block it out in 1-2 hour chunks.
> - **Talk & Listen:** Find people that will listen and then talk their ear off.  But listen to what they don't understand.
> - **Sketch:** This is hard.  Don't be afraid to make mistakes. [Use a visualization topic guide](https://datavizcatalogue.com/) or use [good chart cheatsheet](images/gc/Ch4_chart_ideation.png).
> - **Prototype:** *Next class discussion*

## Talk, Sketch, Listen, Prototype...

After prep, all of these can happen at the same time when you are working in a group. As long as everyone has come prepared. [Hejazi and Voisin climate paper example](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/34/10635/tab-figures-data).

# Supplemental Reading {data-background=#e8c35d}

## [Measures of Spread](https://byuistats.github.io/BYUI_CSE150_StatBook/describing-data.html#measures-of-spread)

If you were a Walmart buyer of cherry tomatoes, what specifications would you give them to make sure you got the size you wanted in the store?

- How might a supplier user your metric to their advantage?
- How could the metric provide safety for Walmart and the supplier?
